4x3 Macropad with Dual Rotary Encoders:

This repository contains the firmware, PCB design files, and documentation for a custom-built 4x3 macropad featuring two rotary encoders, powered by an RP2040 Zero microcontroller and programmed using the QMK (Quantum Mechanical Keyboard) firmware.

Features:

4x3 Key Matrix: 12 customizable mechanical keys arranged in a 4x3 layout.
2 Rotary Encoders: Can be used for volume control, scrolling, or any other action supported by QMK.
RP2040 Zero: Small, powerful microcontroller ideal for custom keyboard projects.
Customizable Firmware: Programmed with QMK firmware, offering extensive customization for key functions, encoder actions, layers, and more.
Open Source Hardware and Firmware: All design files and firmware are open-source.

Project Overview:

This macropad is designed to enhance productivity and streamline workflows for creative professionals, developers, and gamers. The device provides 12 keys, which can be programmed with single keystrokes, macros, or shortcuts, and two rotary encoders that can handle tasks such as volume adjustment or scrolling.
